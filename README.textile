h1. rb8-trepanning a Ruby MRI 1.8 debugger using ruby-debug-base.

This is a rewrite of _ruby-debug_, but still using ruby-debug base. 

Right now, I've only tested on MRI 1.8, but since the code is pure
Ruby, it probably will work on other Rubies that have ruby-debug-base
installed.

h2. Features

* Syntax highlighting (if "coderay":http://coderay.rubychan.de/ and term-ansicolor are installed)
* tab completion of commands
* expanded on-line help
* cleaner, more modular and more testable code

I realize the last item may not be of importance to many, but it's
_very_ important as a developer of the code. 

There is a "google group mailing list":http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-debugger for Ruby debuggers.

h2. Installing (from git)

bq.
   git://github.com/rocky/rb8-trepanning.git
   cd rb8-trepanning
   rake test
   rake install

h2. Background

_ruby-debug_ is cool, but it became getting harder to work on and to
extend it while keeping compatibility. The code never started out
from a test-driven development standpoint--tests were bolted on
afterwards.

Over time, I gained a better understanding of what was important (to
me), and I learned how to do things better. So I decided to rewrite
the code. This code base is a backport of the "trepanning debugger for
Rubinius":https://github.com/rocky/rbx-trepanning/wiki which in turn
is a port of the "trepanning debugger for a patched MRI YARV
1.9.2":https://github.com/rocky/rb-trepanning/wiki which is a port of
code for "a debugger for Python":http://code.google.com/p/pydbgr/
which is a port of ruby-debug)

h2. Compatibility with ruby-debug

Compatiblity between _ruby-debug_ and _trepanning_ is like
compatibility between Ruby 1.8 and Ruby 1.9. 

Here are some incompatibilities. Depending on your point of view, I
hope you will find as I do that these are improvements:

* "set autoeval" is on by default
* ;; rather than ; separates debugger commands. This way, ; can be used in a Ruby statement to evaluate.
* Command names can be abbreviated if they are unique. For example "st" and "ste" are abbreviations of "step". To turn this off, "set abbrev off".
