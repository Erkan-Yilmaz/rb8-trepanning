June 12, 2011 Fleetwood release

First attempt at backport from trepanning.

New features
 - Syntax highlighting (if coderay, term-ansicolor and newer linecache)
 - tab completion (more complete if rb-readline gem used)
 - parsetree (if ParseTree installed)

New commands from trepanning: 
- "eval" and "eval?" without args to run parts of the current source line
- macros
- aliases
- help system
- unique command abbrev (or not if "set abbrev off")

Incompatibilities: 
- autoeval is on by default
- ";;" separates debugger commands so you can use ";" in eval
- some possibliy lesser-used commands have been dropped. If people notice,
  they can be reinstated.
- dropped support for annotations and ruby-debug emacs. Use newer emacs-dbgr

See ruby-debug's CHANGES for older changes
