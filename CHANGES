June 12, 2011 (0.1.3) Fleetwood release

First attempt at backport from trepanning.

New features
 - Syntax highlighting (if coderay, term-ansicolor and newer linecache)
 - tab completion (more complete if rb-readline gem used)
 - parsetree (if ParseTree installed)

New commands from trepanning: 
 - gdb-like "confirm" to turn on/off prompting of dangerous commands
- "eval" and "eval?" without args to run parts of the current source line
- macros
- aliases
- new help system
- unique command abbrev (or not if "set abbrev off")
- new "!" suffix on "quit" and "kill" command, e.g. "q!", to avoid prompting.

Incompatibilities: 
- autoeval is on by default
- ";;" separates debugger commands so you can use ";" in eval
- some possibliy lesser-used commands have been dropped. If people notice,
  they can be reinstated.
- p is now pr to avoid eval confusion with Ruby's "p" method
- dropped support for annotations and ruby-debug emacs. Use newer emacs-dbgr
- some commands have been moved to closer match gdb: 
   * threads -> info threads
   * reload  -> set reload 
   * trace   -> set trace

See ruby-debug's CHANGES for older changes
